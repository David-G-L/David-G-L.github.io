Europe in general, and Spain in particular, have experienced **drought episodes** increasingly over the past decades. These ever more frequent events surely pose threats to food supply security and compromise the stability of the domestic agri-food market. In order to insure agricultural production against those extreme episodes, accurate and efficient agricultural policies should be proposed and measures to adapt production to changing meteorological conditions must be taken. But prior to that, it is required to carefully **assess and quantify the effect of water scarcity scenarios on the productivity of our crops**, *i.e.*, we should have clear the **drought sensitivity of crops**. This remains an open empirical question (some positive and some negative effects). Recent studies detect a clear relationship between crop yields and some drought indices Gunst et al. ([2015](http://www.eu-drought.org/technicalreports){:target="_blank"}). 

>The use of **statistical methods** to approach the relationship between yields and meteorological variables has proliferated during the last decade. This is attributable to the increasing availability and improved quality of observed data, the development of computer tools that can handle big data sets, and the adoption of new observation techniques, like **remote sensing**. Schlenker et al. ([2009](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15594){:target="_blank"}) is a prominent example of this stream of literature. Some authors, like Lobell ([2010](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-90-481-2953-9_5){:target="_blank"}), have even claimed that this approach would beat the explanatory and forecasting performance of traditional crop models.

Regarding the **impact of droughts in the real economy**, a few theoretical exercises linking natural disasters and economic growth have been developed. Other studies prove a clear link between drought episodes and the occurrence of civil conflicts and disease. However, empirical studies addressing specifically the role of droughts in the evolution of crop yields are scarce in the literature, partly because the development of drought indicators has been relatively recent. One of the few examples is the work by Lobell et al. ([2014](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6183/516){:target="_blank"}), applied to the corn belt in the U.S. Midwest. They identify that, despite crop yields have generally increased over the studied period thanks to agronomic changes in plants' drought tolerance, the sensitivity to droughts of some crop varieties, like maize, is greater now than it was at the beginning of the sample. A similar response of Spanish crops could be expected but many heterogeneities could arise due to different geographic, agronomic, or productive motives. **Our study will shed light onto the reactivity of Spanish fields to drought events**.

Also very recently, Stagge et al. ([2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415007222){:target="_blank"}), using qualitative user-provided drought impact indicators spanning agriculture, energy and industry, public water supply, and freshwater ecosystem across five European countries. They build logistic regression models and demonstrate the feasibility of using such models to predict drought impact likelihood based on meteorological drought indices. In our case, we will focus specifically on the **non-irrigated agricultural sector** and we will isolate ourselves from any kind of qualitative indicator, adopting instead, crop yields as the main source of detection of drought impacts. 

<br>

An obstacle to measuring progress in farmers’ fields has been the lack of accurate field-level data on both environmental conditions and yield performance that span a range of drought conditions and time. We will overcome this obstacle by using the **Encuesta sobre Superficies y Rendimientos de los Cultivos ([ESYRCE](http://www.magrama.gob.es/es/estadistica/temas/estadisticas-agrarias/agricultura/esyrce/base-legal-objetivos-y-sintesis-metodologica/default.aspx){:target="_blank"})**. The ESYRCE survey serves as input to the European Commision's [<b>FADN</b>](http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/rica/){:target="_blank"}. ESYRCE is an annual survey conducted by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture in which field-level data on surface and yields is collected and interpolated to construct a country-gridded data set spanning years 1990 to date. Great spatial and crop disaggregation is key to unveil plausible evidence because some areas are more prone to suffering from drought events due to their geographic and orographic characteristics. At the same time, some crop varieties will bear more efficiently with abrupt changes in average climate patterns. Hence, deploying our study at the finest disaggregation level available is crucial to obtain meaningful results. Spatial heterogeneous responses of economic outcomes in response to weather variables have been previously documented in Ceglar et al. ([2016](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192315007303){:target="_blank"}) or García-León ([2014]({{ site.url }}/DGL01){:target="_blank"}) for European regions. 

>We will measure the degree of sensitivity of certain agronomic variables (yield) to traditional weather variables and 
drought-specific indicators, as those delivered by the **GEISEQ system**, (see the [Infosequia](http://www.infosequia.es/){:target="_blank"} portal).

According to the **IPCC** ([2014](https://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/){:target="_blank"}) and other organisms, like the [<b>UNCCD</b>](http://www.unccd.int/en/Pages/default.aspx){:target="_blank"}, there is a need to integrate both scientific and local knowledge to allow for a better understanding of adaptive capacities and a better anticipation of complex interactions between biophysical and social systems in specific settings. Applied to our case study, another way of capturing changes in the evolution of crop yields in response to droughts rests on the difference between the impacts of climate change projected using the short-run (limited adaptation) and long-run (substantial adaptation) response curves. This difference can be interpreted as the **private adaptation** potential. 

<br>

Analogously to the case of drought impacts, there are scarce empirical estimates of private adaptation of farmers to changing climate. Lobell et al. ([2014](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n7/full/nclimate2228.html){:target="_blank"}, [2015](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/9/2670){:target="_blank"}) for Europe and Huang ([2015](https://economics.adelaide.edu.au/research/papers/doc/wp2015-20.pdf){:target="_blank"}) for the US are some of the few examples available. The former authors estimate adaptation by jointly estimating both short-run and long-run response functions using time-series and cross-sectional variation in subnational yield and profit data that we will adapt to our example at hand. They also develop statistical tests for Climate Change impacts and adaptation that could be easily accommodated to study the adaptation behaviour in response to droughts.
