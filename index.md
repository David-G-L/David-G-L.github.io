## About

I am a Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Research Fellow at the [Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei](http://www.feem.it/){:target="_blank"} where I develop my project **WATER DROP** (*Droughts and Water Scarcity in the EU: Economic Impact, Adaptation, Policy Implications and Integrated Assessment Modelling*).

My research interests are mainly the economic and social costs of Climate Change, Environmental Economics, and Economic Development and Growth. By examining local and regional data and by using statistical and econometric techniques, I try to understand the relationship between society and the environment. I am very much interested in computer  programming and steadily searching for innovative ways of displaying data. 

Prior to joining the [University of Alicante](http://www.ua.es/){:target="_blank"}, I obtained a Master's Degree in Economics 
and Finance at [CEMFI](http://www.cemfi.es/){:target="_blank"}. Then, I worked for a couple of years at the 
[Research Department](http://www.bde.es/investigador/en/){:target="_blank"} of the 
[Bank of Spain](http://www.bde.es/){:target="_blank"}  where I mostly worked on the implementation of real-time forecasting 
techniques and the monitoring and analysis of fiscal policies.
