I am a Science Adviser to the [Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food](https://www.mapa.gob.es/en/){:target="_blank"}. I provide advice to the Minister, bridging the gap between scientific research and policy decisions. My goal is to ensure that the latest insights from the scientific community inform strategies for sustainable development.

My research interests span several disciplines, and are always headed to understand the socio-economic effects of the environment on human activities, with a particular focus on low-probability, high-impact climate events. I am interested in computer programming and am steadily looking for innovative and efficient ways of displaying data. I am a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research.

Previously, I worked as Scientific Officer at the European Commission's [Joint Research Centre](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I was Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/){:target="_blank"} and the [Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change](https://www.cmcc.it/){:target="_blank"}, where I implemented my project [**WATER DROP**](https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/407029-pinning-down-the-cost-of-drought-in-mediterranean-countries){:target="_blank"} on the economic assessment of droughts. I received my PhD in Quantitative Economics at the University of Alicante (Spain). Before that, I worked at the [Research Department of the Bank of Spain](http://www.bde.es/investigador/en/){:target="_blank"} and obtained a Master's Degree in Economics and Finance at [CEMFI](http://www.cemfi.es/){:target="_blank"}. I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics at the [University of Murcia](https://www.um.es/){:target="_blank"} (Spain) and the [Manchester Metropolitan University](https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (UK).
