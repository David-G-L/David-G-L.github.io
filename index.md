I am a Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei](http://www.feem.it/){:target="_blank"}, where I develop my project [**WATER DROP**](http://www.water-drop.eu/){:target="_blank"} (*Droughts and Water Scarcity in the EU: Economic Impact, Adaptation, Policy Implications and Integrated Assessment Modelling*). 

My current research focuses on the estimation and analysis of drought impacts on European agriculture systems in the context of climate change. I rely on statistical and process-based methods as well as on satellite imagery, machine learning and farm level data to capture these interactions. I also develop methods to implement drought early warning systems.

My research interests vary from Environmental Economics to the economic and social impacts of Climate Change, including data science for food security and the economic implications of climate extremes. I am interested in computer programming while steadily search for innovative ways of displaying data. I am a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research. I make most of my codes available in public repositories.

Prior to joining FEEM, I worked at the [Research Department of the Bank of Spain](http://www.bde.es/investigador/en/){:target="_blank"}, where I implemented GDP real-time forecasting tools and monitored euro area Member States fiscal policies. I received my PhD in Quantitative Economics at the University of Alicante (Spain) and obtained a Master's Degree in Economics and Finance at  [CEMFI](http://www.cemfi.es/){:target="_blank"}. I completed my undergraduate studies in economics at the University of Murcia (Spain) and the Manchester Metropolitan University (UK).
