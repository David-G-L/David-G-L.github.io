I am a Scientific Officer at the [Joint Research Centre](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/){:target="_blank"} of the European Commission, where I contribute to study and assess the economic effects of climate change at the global and EU levels, including the cross-sectoral impacts, as well as the effectiveness of alternative adaptation policies.

My research interests span several disciplines, and are always headed to understand the socio-economic effects of the environment on human activities, with a particular focus on low-probability, high-impact climate events. I am interested in computer programming and am steadily looking for innovative and efficient ways of displaying data. I am a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research.

Previously, I was a Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/){:target="_blank"} and the [Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change](https://www.cmcc.it/){:target="_blank"}, where I implemented my project [**WATER DROP**](https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/407029-pinning-down-the-cost-of-drought-in-mediterranean-countries){:target="_blank"} on the economic assessment of droughts. I received my PhD in Quantitative Economics at the University of Alicante (Spain). Before that, I worked at the [Research Department of the Bank of Spain](http://www.bde.es/investigador/en/){:target="_blank"} and obtained a Master's Degree in Economics and Finance at [CEMFI](http://www.cemfi.es/){:target="_blank"}. I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics at the [University of Murcia](https://www.um.es/){:target="_blank"} (Spain) and the [Manchester Metropolitan University](https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (UK).
