##About

I am a Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Research Fellow at the [Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei](http://www.feem.it/){:target="_blank"}, where I develop my project **WATER DROP** (*Droughts and Water Scarcity in the EU: Economic Impact, Adaptation, Policy Implications and Integrated Assessment Modelling*).

My research interests vary from Environmental Economics to the economic and social impacts of Climate Change. By examining local and regional data and by using statistical and econometric techniques, I try to understand the relationship between society and the environment. I am very much interested in computer  programming and steadily searching for innovative ways of displaying data. 

Prior to joining FEEM, I earned my PhD in Qunatitative Economics at the [University of Alicante (http://www.ua.es/){:target="_blank"} and obtained a Master's Degree in Economics and Finance at [CEMFI](http://www.cemfi.es/){:target="_blank"}. I also used to work for a couple of years at the [Research Department](http://www.bde.es/investigador/en/){:target="_blank"} of the  [Bank of Spain](http://www.bde.es/){:target="_blank"}  where I mostly worked on the implementation of real-time forecasting techniques and the monitoring and analysis of fiscal policies.
