The biophysical impact of extreme temperatures on the performance of workers is manifested by altering human physiology and cognition processes. This has a negative effect on the work capacity of the labour force, leading to temporarily lower labour productivity and economic output. Inspired by the emerging literature on bottom-up assessments of climate risks, this paper proposes a method that estimates, upon leveraging local-level heat stress impacts, the economy-wide cost of heatwaves by integrating regional- and sector-specific productivity losses into a regionalised general equilibrium model, thus enabling for market adaptation mechanisms. We study the most representative and analyse the implications of climate change to this area by combining features a very detailed spatial and temporal precision: i) 274 regions (EU+EFTA countries) simultaneously analysed; ii) Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) indicator retrieved every hour; iii) economic sectors classified according to their different heat exposure (indoor/ outdoor activities and metabolic intensity load); iv) different heat-exposure functions analysed; v) two climate scenarios compared and; vi) average estimate costs for the period 2035-2064 produced. The integrated modelling tool proposed here can also help to assess the implementation of regional-sectoral occupational health and adaptation plans at the workplace.
